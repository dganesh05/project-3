## üéØ Overview

This project analyzes over **4.4 million** PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) match records to predict player placement and identify a critical business problem: **high-performing players experiencing unexpected losses due to unmeasurable factors**.

By building regression models that achieve **80.6% R¬≤**, we identify the **19.4% unexplained variance** and use this as a "frustration score" to detect players at risk of churn. The analysis reveals that frustrated players are not underperforming‚Äîthey're **overperforming** on all measurable metrics (63% more walkDistance, 66% more weapons, 557% more aggression) but still lose to factors outside their control.

**Key Insight:** The most frustrated 1% of players represent the game's **highest-value segment**‚Äîexperienced, aggressive, engaged players who are statistically more likely to spend money and influence community sentiment.

## üí° Problem Statement

In battle royale games, player experience is defined by more than just winning. A player who performs well but loses due to bad luck has a vastly different experience than a casual player who underperforms as expected.

**Research Question:**  
*Can we use in-match player actions to predict expected placement, then use prediction errors to quantify match frustration and identify players at churn risk?*

**Business Value:**  
Identifying frustrated high-performers allows game developers to:
- Implement targeted retention strategies
- Fine-tune game balance to reduce RNG impact
- Provide transparency through post-match analytics
- Reward performance beyond just placement

## üîç Key Findings

### Model Performance
| Model | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ | Key Insight |
|-------|-----|------|----|-------------|
| **Linear Regression** | 0.1213 | 0.1561 | 0.7416 | Baseline; struggles with bounded predictions |
| **Random Forest** | 0.0992 | 0.1362 | 0.8035 | Handles non-linearity; reveals 92% feature importance in walkDistance |
| **LightGBM** | 0.0986 | 0.1354 | **0.8056** | Best performance with engineered features |

### Frustration Analysis
- **19.4% unexplained variance** represents factors beyond player control (circle RNG, opponent skill, positioning)
- Frustrated players (bottom 1% of residuals) show **paradoxical superiority**:
  - +63% walkDistance (survival time)
  - +66% weapons acquired (looting effectiveness)
  - +557% aggression score (combat engagement)
- Yet they place **17 percentile points below predictions**

### Feature Importance
1. **walkDistance** (42.95%) - Survival time is king
2. **walk_squared** (34.21%) - Exponential survival advantage
3. **walk_x_weapons** (14.10%) - Looting effectiveness given survival time
4. **Other features** (<10%) - Combat, efficiency, playstyle modifiers

**Strategy: Survive ‚Üí Prepare ‚Üí Win**

## üìä Dataset

**Source:** [PUBG Finish Placement Prediction (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction)

**Size:** 4,446,966 player records across ~47,000 matches

**Target Variable:**  
- `winPlacePerc`: Continuous [0.0, 1.0] representing placement percentile

**Key Features (29 total):**
- **Combat:** kills, damageDealt, killStreaks, longestKill
- **Survival:** walkDistance, rideDistance, swimDistance
- **Resources:** weaponsAcquired, boosts, heals
- **Team:** assists, revives, DBNOs
- **Meta:** matchType (solo/duo/squad, FPP/TPP)

**Data Quality:**
- Only 1 missing value (winPlacePerc) in 4.4M rows
- 212 records (0.005%) removed for suspected cheating (>40 kills or >1.5 kills/min)
- killPlace removed due to data leakage (post-match ranking)

---

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Target distribution analysis (bimodal: early deaths vs winners)
- Multicollinearity detection via VIF (removed assists, headshotKills, DBNOs)
- Outlier investigation (cheater detection, kills per minute analysis)
- Match-type stratification (solo vs duo vs squad correlations)

### 2. Feature Engineering
**Interaction Features** (conditional effectiveness):
```python
walk_x_weapons = walkDistance √ó weaponsAcquired    # Looting efficiency
walk_x_kills = walkDistance √ó kills                # Combat effectiveness
walk_x_boosts = walkDistance √ó boosts              # Resource management
```

**Efficiency Ratios**:
```python
kills_per_distance = kills / (walkDistance + 1)    # Combat efficiency
weapons_per_distance = weapons / (walkDistance + 1) # Looting efficiency
```

**Playstyle Indicators**:
```python
aggression_score = (kills √ó 10 + damage/100) / (walkDistance + 1)
passive_score = walkDistance / (kills + 1)
```

**Non-linear Transformations**:
```python
walk_squared = walkDistance¬≤                        # Exponential survival advantage
log1p(rideDistance), log1p(longestKill)            # Diminishing returns
```

### 3. Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Remove missing values and outliers
2. Log-transform skewed features (rideDistance, longestKill)
3. Target encode matchType (mean winPlacePerc per category)
4. StandardScaler for all numerical features
5. Train/validation split (80/20)

### 4. Model Selection
- **Experiment 1:** Linear Regression (baseline)
- **Experiment 2:** Random Forest Regressor (handle non-linearity, multicollinearity)
- **Experiment 3:** LightGBM (efficiency + engineered features)

### 5. Frustration Score Calculation
```python
frustration_score = actual_placement - predicted_placement
frustrated_players = bottom 1% of residuals (highest underperformance)
```

## üíº Business Impact

### Recommendations for Game Developers

**A. Reduce RNG Impact (Make Skill Matter More)**
1. **Predictable Circle Mechanics**
   - Show next 2 zones instead of 1
   - Weight circle spawns toward current zone center (70% probability)
   - Add probability heatmaps for next zone
   
2. **Skill-Based Matchmaking**
   - Implement hidden MMR system
   - Reduce "ran into a pro" scenarios
   - A/B test loose SBMM (¬±200 MMR range)

3. **Consistent Loot Distribution**
   - Guarantee high-tier loot zones
   - Dynamic loot balancing (if 5 buildings = no scope, next guarantees one)

**B. Transparency & Feedback**
1. **Post-Match Analytics Dashboard**
   ```
   üìä YOUR STATS:
   Placement: 35th percentile
   Walk Distance: 1,884m (Top 25% ‚≠ê)
   Weapons: 5 (Top 40% ‚≠ê)
   
   üéØ PREDICTED: 52nd percentile
   You SHOULD have placed better!
   
   ‚ùå WHAT WENT WRONG:
   ‚Ä¢ Circle spawned away from you 3 times (bad luck)
   ‚Ä¢ Encountered top 5% skilled opponent
   ‚Ä¢ Final circle positioning: 8th percentile
   
   üí° YOU PLAYED WELL! Focus on positioning.
   ```

2. **Positive Loss Messaging**
   - Replace "Rank 65/100" with "Top 25% survival, tough luck this round!"

**C. Reward Performance Beyond Placement**
1. **Multi-Dimensional Ranking**
   - Placement MMR (current)
   - Combat MMR (kills, damage)
   - Survival MMR (walkDistance, efficiency)

2. **Performance-Based Bonuses**
   - Top 20% walkDistance: +50 BP
   - Top 20% combat: +50 BP
   - "Overperformed prediction": +100 BP

### Expected Impact
- **15-30% reduction in churn** among high-performing players
- **Protect 2-5% of revenue** (frustrated players are high-engagement = high-LTV)
- **Reduce brand risk** from influencer/streamer frustration
- **Improve perceived fairness** across all player segments
